# LeetMetric-App
I have created a web page using HTML, CSS, and JS. It is used to show the progress made on the Leetcode platform. When a user enters his/her username and search, it shows the amount of total Ques Solved, total Submissions made and other necessary points also.. Types of ques and their percentage is also shown in circle type conic gradient. All this I have learnt and made by the help of Love Babbar Web Development videos on YT. I hope you liked it. You can give suggestions to improve my project. Thanks!
